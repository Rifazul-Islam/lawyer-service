          <Card.Text>
              SQL programming can be effectively used to insert, search, update, delete database records.
               That doesnt mean SQL cannot do things beyond that. It can do a lot of things including, but not limited.
              NoSQL is a non-relational DMS, that does not require a fixed schema, avoids joins, and is easy to scale. NoSQL database is used for distributed data stores with
              humongous data storage needs. NoSQL is used for Big data and real-time web apps

      <Card.Title> 2. What is JWT, and how does it work? ...?</Card.Title>
      <Card.Text>
      Likewise, we frequently see JWTs conflated with the pattern of JWT-based 
      authentication. JWT on its own is nothing but an open standard (RFC 7519) for transmitting messages via HTTP. JWT as a standard can be used for any message at all. It has one characteristic in particular that makes it a good tool for sending a userâ€™s identity to a backend service. We can trust the integrity of a JWT
       because JWTs are signed, making them tamper-proof.
